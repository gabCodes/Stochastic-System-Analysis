General purpose of each file:
ss_generator - generate state space for the given assignment conditions
stability_analysis - perform the stability analysis
time_domain_analysis - perform the time domain analysis
spectral analysis - perform the spectral analysis AND compute variances

In order to see the results shown in the report do the following:
Stability Analysis:
- Run to check stability assessment of damped/undamped
- If the pole zero maps are desired uncomment the according pzmap function

Time Domain Analysis:
Run time_domain_analysis for the plots

Spectral Analysis:
Run spectral_analysis for the plots (ignore the redundant timeseries plot)

Variances:
Run spectral_analysis and once its been run to completion type into console:
tab_u = Undamped variances computed via Var.m
tab_pd = Damped variances computed via Var.m
tab_au = Analytical undamped variances
tab_ad = Analytical damped variances
tab_fu = FFT undamped variances
tab_fd = FFT damped variances
tab_pwu = pwelch undamped variances
tab_pwd = pwelch damped variances
